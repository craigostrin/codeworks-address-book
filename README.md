# codeworks-address-book
Coding assignment for Codeworks admission

**Deadline: February 14, 2023**

## Spec
Build a simple address book application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 

It’s a page that opens in the browser and looks like an address book you would find in a cell phone.

### Requirements
- Each contact should have a name, surname, phone number, and address.
- The data does not need to persist when the browser page is closed.
- The user needs to be able to create new contacts and delete contacts.
- There needs to be a search bar where the user can find existing contacts.
- Your CSS needs to be clean.
- Use 3 separate files: one for CSS, one for HTML, and one for JavaScript.
- Use jQuery to interact with the DOM.

If your submission contains multiple lines of code taken from any online sources (like code snippets, articles, tutorials, etc.) add a comment citing that work. Copying code without attribution will disqualify you.

### Submission

We will review your code and send you your outcome within 2-3 business days.
